# **Twitter Sentiment Analysis with RNN**

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for performing **entity-level sentiment analysis** on Twitter data. The goal is to predict the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of a given tweet about a particular entity. This sentiment analysis task involves evaluating how tweets relate to entities mentioned in them, making it useful for brand monitoring, public opinion analysis, and social media insights.

## About the Dataset  

### Dataset Description  
- **Number of Rows:** 74,682  
- **Number of Columns:** 4  
- **Classes:**  
  - **Positive**  
  - **Negative**  
  - **Neutral** (Tweets that are irrelevant to the entity are considered Neutral)  

### Features  
| Feature Name   | Description                                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tweet_ID**   | Unique identifier for each tweet (integer)             |
| **entity**     | Entity (e.g., company name, product, person, etc.)      |
| **sentiment**  | The sentiment of the tweet towards the entity (Positive, Negative, Neutral) |
| **Tweet_content** | The actual text content of the tweet                  |

### Key Observations  
- The dataset is primarily concerned with understanding the sentiment of tweets about specific entities.  
- The **Neutral** category includes tweets that are irrelevant to the entity mentioned.  
- The data is balanced across the three sentiment classes (Positive, Negative, and Neutral).

## Objective  

- **Sentiment Classification:**  
  Develop an RNN model to predict the sentiment of tweets regarding the given entity.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Analyzing public sentiment towards brands, products, or public figures.  
  - Understanding consumer opinions and feedback in real-time.  
  - Monitoring social media for sentiment-driven events and trends.

## Methodology  

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - **Text Preprocessing:**  
     - Tokenization, removing stop words, and lemmatization.  
     - Text vectorization using techniques like **TF-IDF** or **Word Embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe).  
   - **Label Encoding:**  
     - Convert sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral) into numerical format using label encoding or one-hot encoding.  
   
### 2. **Model Development**  
   - **RNN Architecture:**  
     - Use an RNN or **LSTM/GRU** to capture the sequential nature of tweet data.  
   - **Embedding Layer:**  
     - Pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec) for better understanding of words in context.  
   - **Dense Layer:**  
     - Fully connected layers for classification into the three sentiment classes.  
   - **Activation Functions:**  
     - **Softmax** for multi-class classification in the output layer.  

### 3. **Model Training and Optimization**  
   - **Loss Function:** **Categorical Cross-Entropy**  
   - **Optimizers:** **Adam**, **RMSprop**  
   - **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

### 4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate the model using a **confusion matrix** and **classification report**.  
   - Analyze precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance on each sentiment class.  

### 5. **Visualization**  
   - Visualize training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs.  
   - Visualize sample tweet predictions and misclassifications.
